This is my more offical way of showing what im currently working on. 😎

I will try and keep this as up to date as I can. 😷

This wont have all my current projects mainly because to update and add everything isn't necessary. 😖

This is more or less just what I feel like is worthy of being showed to the public. 😵

Plus everything on here is from my laptop and not my desktop, so that wont help about the amount of things here. 💻

Also, Im using this to learn how to use Git for future reference. 😃

Moral of the story is that this is just a cluster of learning for both python and c++, on top of learning Git. ^_^
