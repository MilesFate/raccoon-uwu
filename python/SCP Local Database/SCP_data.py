    -----------------
    Object Class: Euclid
    ----------------------
    Special Containment Procedures: 
    Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. 
    When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter 
    at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. 
    At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 
    until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Moved to Site-19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. 
    It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. 
    SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. 
    Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. 
    Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. 
    Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. 
    In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside. 
    This is considered normal, and any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL 
    supervisor on duty.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and blood. 
    Origin of these materials is unknown. The enclosure must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.

    Item #: SCP-096
    -----------------
    Object Class: Euclid
    ---------------------
    Special Containment Procedures: SCP-096 is to be contained in its cell, 
    a 5m x 5m x 5m airtight steel cube, at all times. 
    Weekly checks for any cracks or holes are mandatory. 
    There are to be absolutely no video surveillance or optical tools of any kind inside SCP-096's cell. 
    Security personnel will use pre-installed pressure sensors and laser detectors to ensure 
    SCP-096's presence inside the cell.
    Any and all photos, video, or recordings of SCP-096's likeness are strictly forbidden 
    without approval from Dr. ███ and O5-█.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description: SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. 
    Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass 
    suggesting mild malnutrition. 
    Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, with an 
    approximate length of 1.5 meters each. 
    Skin is mostly devoid of pigmentation, with no sign of any body hair.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SCP-096's jaw can open to four (4) times the norm of an average human. 
    Other facial features remain similar to an average human, with the exception of the eyes, 
    which are also devoid of pigmentation. 
    It is not yet known whether SCP-096 is blind or not. It shows no signs of any higher brain functions, 
    and is not considered to be sapient.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SCP-096 is normally extremely docile, with pressure sensors inside its cell 
    indicating it spends most of the day pacing by the eastern wall. 
    However, when someone views SCP-096's face, whether it be directly, via video recording, 
    or even a photograph, it will enter a stage of considerable emotional distress. 
    SCP-096 will cover its face with its hands and begin screaming, crying, and babbling incoherently. 
    Approximately one (1) to two (2) minutes after the first viewing, 
    SCP-096 will begin running to the person who viewed its face (who will from this point on be 
    referred to as SCP-096-1).
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Documented speeds have varied from thirty-five (35) km/h to ███ km/h, and seems to depend on 
    distance from SCP-096-1. 
    At this point, no known material or method can impede SCP-096's progress. 
    The actual position of SCP-096-1 does not seem to affect SCP-096's response; it seems to have an 
    innate sense of SCP-096-1's location. 
    Note: This reaction does not occur when viewing artistic depictions .
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Upon arriving at SCP-096-1's location, SCP-096 will proceed to kill and [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-096-1. 100% 
    of cases have left no traces of SCP-096-1. 
    SCP-096 will then sit down for several minutes before regaining its composure and becoming docile once again. 
    It will then attempt to make its way back to its natural habitat, [DATA REDACTED]
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Due to the possibility of a mass chain reaction, including breach of Foundation secrecy and large 
    civilian loss of life, 
    retrieval of subject should be considered Alpha priority.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Dr. ███ has also petitioned for immediate termination of SCP-096. 
    Order is awaiting approval. Termination order has been approved, and is to be carried out by 
    Dr. ███ on [DATA REDACTED].
